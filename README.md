# cubic_zirconia

## Problem Statement:

Hired by a company Gem Stones co ltd, which is a cubic zirconia manufacturer, provided with the dataset containing the prices and other attributes of almost 27,000 cubic zirconia (which is an inexpensive diamond alternative with many of the same qualities as a diamond). As a data analyst, I've provided visualization uding differnet graphs and charts in order to understand the dataset and its correlation better.
